## National_Stormwater_Calculator_Desktop

This is the source code repository for the desktop version of EPA's National Stormwater Calculator (SWC).  The SWC is a software application that estimates the annual amount of rainwater and frequency of runoff from a specific site. Estimates are based on local soil conditions, land cover, and historic rainfall records. It is designed to be used by anyone interested in reducing runoff from a property, including site developers, landscape architects, urban planners, and homeowners.

The SWC accesses several national databases that provide soil, topography, rainfall, and evaporation information for a chosen site. The user supplies information about the siteâ€™s land cover and selects low impact development (LID) controls they would like to use. The LID controls include seven green infrastructure practices.

The SWC can be downloaded at the offical [website](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/national-stormwater-calculator).
